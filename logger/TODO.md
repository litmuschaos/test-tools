## ITEMS TODO
--------------

- GET SYSTEMD(KUBELET)LOGS OF APPLICATION NODE - Done (Refer https://github.com/openebs/test-storage/pull/30/)
- ADD LOGIC TO PARSE SYSTEMD LOGS FROM NODELOGGER
- LEVERAGE STERN FLAGS (EX: NAMESPACES, CAN GET KUBE-SYSTEM POD LOGS AS WELL)
- CONSTRUCT STERN CONFIGMAP (ONCE WE USE MORE FLAGS)
- ABILITY TO PARSE/MAP OUT APP-PVC LOGS IN SUPPORT BUNDLE
- ARE THERE USEFUL LOGS NOT SHOWING UP ON STDOUT
- COLOR CODE (STERN DOES THIS IF NOT REDIRECTED TO LOGFILE)
- IDENTIFY PATTERNS ON THE LOGS (FLOODING CASES)

USER FEEDBACK !!!!
