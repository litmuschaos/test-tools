About
=====

SysBench is a modular, cross-platform and multi-threaded benchmark tool
for evaluating OS parameters that are important for a system running a
database under intensive load.

The idea of this benchmark suite is to quickly get an impression about
system performance without setting up complex database benchmarks or
even without installing a database at all.

Features
--------

Current features allow to test the following system parameters:

-   file I/O performance

-   scheduler performance

-   memory allocation and transfer speed

-   POSIX threads implementation performance

-   database server performance

Installation
------------

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make

The above will build SysBench with MySQL support by default. If you have MySQL headers and libraries in non-standard locations (and no `mysql_config` can be found in the `PATH`), you can specify them explicitly with `--with-mysql-includes` and `--with-mysql-libs` options to `./configure`.

To compile SysBench without MySQL support, use `--without-mysql`. In
this case all database-related tests will not work, but other tests will
be functional.

Usage
=====

General syntax
--------------

The general syntax for SysBench is as follows:

		  sysbench [common-options] --test=name [test-options] command


See [General command line options](README.md#general-command-line-options) for a description of common options and documentation for particular test mode for a list of test-specific options.

Below is a brief description of available commands and their purpose:

+ `prepare`: performs preparative actions for those tests which need
them, e.g. creating the necessary files on disk for the `fileio` test,
or filling the test database for OLTP tests.
+ `run`: runs the actual test specified with the `--test` option.
+ `cleanup`: removes temporary data after the test run in those tests which create one.
+ `help`: displays usage information for a test specified with the
  `--test` option.

Also you can use `sysbench help` (without `--test`) to display the brief usage summary and the list of available test modes.

| `--percentile`        | SysBench measures execution times for all processed requests to display statistical information like minimal, average and maximum execution time. For most benchmarks it is also useful to know a request execution time value matching some percentile (e.g. 95% percentile means we should drop 5% of the most long requests and choose the maximal value from the remaining ones). This option allows to specify a percentile rank of query execution times to count | 95              |
| `--validate`          | Perform validation of test results where possible                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | off             |

Note that numerical values for all *size* options (like `--thread-stack-size` in this table) may be specified by appending the corresponding multiplicative suffix (K for kilobytes, M for megabytes, G for gigabytes and T for terabytes).
