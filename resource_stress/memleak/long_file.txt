Memory Test
To test what happens when a pod’s memory gets maxed out, we ran a simple python program:

***Max-Out Memory***
giant_string = ''
while True:
    with open('long_file.txt', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            giant_string+=line

The program reads a very large text file and continuously appends it to a growing string. The outcome we observed was that memory consumption grew until the node transitioned to a “Node Not Ready” state. The offending pod and its neighbor pods on that node were then rescheduled elsewhere.
