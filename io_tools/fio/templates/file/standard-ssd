# Do some important numbers on SSD drives, to gauge what kind of
# performance you might get out of them.
#
# Sequential read and write speeds are tested, these are expected to be
# high. Random reads should also be fast, random writes are where crap
# drives are usually separated from the good drives.
#
# This uses a queue depth of 32 (As this is more representative of mid-heavy disk use)
