# Contributing to test-tools

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This repository holds the auxiliary tools and container images used to exercise and observe Litmus chaos experiments — load generators, stress utilities, log helpers, and similar.

## Getting Started

### Ask Questions or Discuss Ideas

Join the community on [Slack](https://slack.litmuschaos.io) and post in **#litmus** for general questions or **#litmus-dev** for technical discussions.

### Report Issues or Propose Changes

Open a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/litmuschaos/test-tools/issues/new) describing your request, bug, or feature idea. For larger changes, please open an issue and reach agreement with the maintainers before writing code.

## What Lives Here

Tools are organised one directory per tool, each with its own `Dockerfile` and build scripts. `custom/` holds purpose-built utilities, `log_utils/` log tooling, and `resource_stress/` load and stress generators.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All contributions must be signed off with the **Developer Certificate of Origin**, confirming you have the legal right to submit your work. Add a line to every commit message:

To sign off automatically, set your git identity and use `git commit -s`:

```

Use your real name — no pseudonyms or anonymous commits. For full details, see the [DCO documentation](https://developercertificate.org/).

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch from the default branch.
2. **Make your change.** Keep pull requests focused on a single concern.
3. **Validate locally** before pushing — see below.
4. **Open the pull request**, describing what changed and why. Link the issue it addresses.
5. **Respond to review.** Maintainers will review and may request changes.

## Validating Your Changes

```bash
# Build the image for the tool you changed
cd <tool-directory>
docker build -t test-tools/<tool>:dev .
```

Build the specific tool you touched and confirm the image builds cleanly before opening a pull request.

Never commit secrets, credentials, or kubeconfigs. Check `git diff --staged` before committing.
